# Using gh-refme as a Git Pre-Commit Hook

This guide explains how to use the gh-refme tool as a pre-commit hook in your Git workflow to automatically convert GitHub Actions references to commit hashes for enhanced security.

## What is a Pre-Commit Hook?

A pre-commit hook is a script that Git executes before finalizing a commit. It allows you to automatically run checks or modifications on your changes before they're committed to your repository.

## Benefits of Using gh-refme as a Pre-Commit Hook

- **Automatic Security**: Every commit that modifies workflow files will automatically have GitHub Actions references converted to commit hashes
- **No Manual Work**: You don't need to remember to run gh-refme, it happens automatically
- **Consistent Security Practices**: Ensures all team members follow security best practices
- **Early Detection**: Catch and fix potential security issues before they're committed

## Setting Up the Pre-Commit Hook

### Method 1: Using the Install Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the pre-commit hook is using the included script:

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x gh-refme
chmod +x install-hook.sh

# Run the installation script
./install-hook.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

1. Create a pre-commit hook file in your repository:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

2. Add the following script to the pre-commit hook:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook to convert GitHub references to commit hashes
set -e

# Path to the gh-refme script (update as needed)
REFME_SCRIPT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/gh-refme"

# Check if the script exists
if [ ! -f "$REFME_SCRIPT" ]; then
  echo "Error: gh-refme script not found at $REFME_SCRIPT"
  echo "Please update the script path in the pre-commit hook"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if any workflow files are staged for commit
WORKFLOW_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.github/workflows/.*\.ya?ml$' || true)

if [ -n "$WORKFLOW_FILES" ]; then
  echo "üîí Converting GitHub references in workflow files to commit hashes..."
  
  for file in $WORKFLOW_FILES; do
    echo "Processing $file"
    $REFME_SCRIPT file "$file"
    
    # Re-stage the file if it was modified
    git add "$file"
  done
  
  echo "‚úÖ All workflow files processed!"
fi
```

### Method 3: Team-Wide Setup with pre-commit Framework

For teams, it's often better to use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework which allows sharing hooks across the team:

1. Install the pre-commit framework:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: gh-refme
        name: Convert GitHub Actions to commit hashes
        entry: ./gh-refme file
        language: script
        files: \.github/workflows/.*\.ya?ml$
        pass_filenames: true
```

3. Install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Customizing the Pre-Commit Hook

You can customize the hook behavior with these options:

### Dry Run Mode

To first preview changes without applying them:

```bash
$REFME_SCRIPT file "$file" -n

# If changes look good, run without the -n flag
if [ "$?" -eq 0 ] && confirm "Apply changes?"; then
  $REFME_SCRIPT file "$file"
  git add "$file"
fi
```

### Skip Option

Add a way to skip the hook when needed:

```bash
# Check for skip flag in commit message
if git log -1 --pretty=%B | grep -q "SKIP_REFME"; then
  echo "Skipping gh-refme hook (SKIP_REFME flag detected)"
  exit 0
fi
```

### Error Handling

You may want to add some error handling:

```bash
for file in $WORKFLOW_FILES; do
  echo "Processing $file"
  if ! $REFME_SCRIPT file "$file"; then
    echo "‚ùå Error processing $file"
    echo "You can skip this hook with: git commit --no-verify"
    exit 1
  fi
  git add "$file"
done
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Team Notification on Error

For team environments, you might want to notify when the hook fails:

```bash
# Add to your pre-commit hook
if ! $REFME_SCRIPT file "$file"; then
  REPO_URL=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)
  USER=$(git config user.name)
  MESSAGE="‚ö†Ô∏è gh-refme pre-commit hook failed for $USER on file $file in $REPO_URL"
  
  # Send a message to your team chat (example for Slack webhook)
  if [ -n "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL" ]; then
    curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
      --data "{\"text\":\"$MESSAGE\"}" \
      "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
  fi
  
  exit 1
fi
```

### Selective Processing

You can also make the hook more selective:

```bash
# Only process files that contain GitHub Actions references
if grep -q "uses:" "$file"; then
  echo "GitHub Actions found in $file, processing..."
  $REFME_SCRIPT file "$file"
  git add "$file"
else
  echo "No GitHub Actions in $file, skipping"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

If your hook isn't running, check:
- Permissions: The hook file must be executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`)
- Path: Make sure the path to the gh-refme script is correct
- Installation: For pre-commit framework, ensure you ran `pre-commit install`

### Invalid References Not Being Caught

If references aren't being caught:
- Check file patterns in the grep command
- Ensure your file is being recognized as a GitHub workflow file

### Can't Commit Due to Hook Errors

To temporarily bypass the hook:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the script updated**: Regularly update to the latest version of gh-refme
2. **Test the hook**: Try committing a workflow file with references to verify it works
3. **Documentation**: Make sure your team knows about the hook and why it's important
4. **Backup**: Create backups when modifying files to avoid losing changes
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Also use gh-refme in your CI pipeline for double protection

## Combining with Other Pre-Commit Hooks

You can combine gh-refme with other pre-commit hooks like:
- Code linting
- Secrets scanning
- YAML validation
- Security checks

This creates a comprehensive pre-commit pipeline that ensures both code quality and security.

## Conclusion

Using gh-refme as a pre-commit hook provides an automated way to follow GitHub's security best practices for Actions. This simple integration significantly reduces your repository's vulnerability to supply chain attacks with minimal effort.
